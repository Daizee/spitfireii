Things to do:
Pointer-ify amf3 library - must be done before a stress test or production release - lib will crawl under heavy load
Add subsorts to player/alliance sorting
Need success response message for expelling alliance member
Permission checks on alliance subcommands: canceladdUsertoAlliance, setAllianceFriendship, setAllInfoForAlliance, agreeComeinAllianceByLeader, kickOutMemberfromAlliance
Allow players to accept alliance invites
Add code to calculate "pay by cents" cost for research and buildings (automatically figures the least expensive speed up items)
Use SQLite for local data (items, heroes, tiles)
Timer on closed clients (currently leaves sockets open) to prevent clients never closing them when they should
Save data - Ideally save as actions are performed to prevent data loss
Load connecting itemxml from itemxml.xml or sql



Bugs:
Can apply to the same alliance multiple times
Alliance members show up as "neutral" on mapInfoSimple
Gold suddenly jumps to 8 quadrillion randomly? Need to find out how and where
