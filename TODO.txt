Things to do:
Pointer-ify amf3 library
Add subsorts to player/alliance sorting
Need success response message for expelling alliance member
Permission checks on alliance subcommands: canceladdUsertoAlliance, setAllianceFriendship, setAllInfoForAlliance, agreeComeinAllianceByLeader, kickOutMemberfromAlliance
Allow players to accept alliance invites
Add code to calculate "pay by cents" cost for research and buildings (automatically figures the least expensive speed up items)



Bugs:
Can apply to the same alliance multiple times
Alliance members show up as "neutral" on mapInfoSimple
Gold suddenly jumps to 8 quadrillion randomly? Need to find out how and where
